   "Overview": "We invest in the best early-stage Latam SaaS companies.\n\nWe are looking for companies that have their MVP/product live and are already generating some revenue from unaffiliated customers.\nThese startups are typically raising their first investment checks and aim to validate their product-market fit before entering a scale-up phase.\n\nSaaSholic is managed by SaaS operators, not analysts from the financial market or wealthy but inexperienced individual angels. We’ve been there and we know what it takes for a SaaS business to be successful.\n\nWe typically help our portfolio startups with go-to-market, marketing strategy, creating and scaling their salesforce, choosing the right tech infrastructure, company culture, leadership principles, and Delaware/Cayman incorporation.\n\n(We’re not referring to the Silicon Valley cliché tips everyone reads in books and articles. We’re talking about real-life things that we’ve been through or have seen working in the LatAm market peculiarities.)\n\nPartners:\n\nDiego Gomes is also a co-founder @Rock Content. In his spare time, he coauthors the SaaSWorld Research and is always looking to support/invest in promising SaaS early-stage startups. Diego is also the creator of Dealbook.co, a platform to track angels and VC deals in LatAm. He is also an Endeavor entrepreneur and mentor.\n\nGustavo Souza is a Managing Partner at SaaSholic, an early stage micro-VC focused on LATAM SaaS. Experienced in sales and managing enterprise-focused SaaS products. Gustavo is a lawyer by formation but has found in sales+marketing his areas of true interest and excellence.\n\nWilliam Cordeiro is a Venture Capitalist based in Brazil. Over the last 5 years, he built GVAngels, one of the most active angel networks in the country where he lead close to 50 deals and have had deployed over U$15M. He's currently a managing partner at SaaSholic, a leading Micro VC focused on SaaS companies in LatAm.",

We don’t invest in consumer start-ups, or subscription services that have elements of recurring revenue but are not primarily software products. \n\nSaaStr Fund invests in 4-5 awesome SaaS start-ups a year, generally in the $0.1m to $2m ARR range.  Before $10k MRR is usually a bit too early for us, and after $2m ARR or so is usually a bit late and Series A.\n\nPre-revenue is too early.  We can only invest if you have at least 10 Unaffiliated Customers, and ideally, $10k+ or more in MRR.\n\nWe invest in founders that are a part of the SaaStr community.  That’s probably you if you got here :). But if you’ve never heard of SaaStr, never read a SaaStr post, heard our podcast, or been to one of our events ... there are probably better sources of capital.\n\nWe are OK with startups based anywhere in the world (SaaS has flattened), but prefer folks that come to Bay Area frequently.  It does make it easier to recruit, fundraise, partner, etc.  At least in normal times.  ",

   "Overview": "I'm a tech entrepreneur and angel investor on a mission to end aging. In college I focused on neuroscience and did some MRI-based research at Mass General Hospital. I've also been interested in aging and longevity since first hearing the concept of Longevity Escape Velocity in 2007. Since graduating I built and sold 4 companies, reaching over 80 million users. I'm a self-taught software engineer and highly operational CEO, largely with a product inclination, at the 4 companies. I love the intersection of behavior and tech. In the past 18 months, anguished by the unnecessary deaths and institutional incompetence in COVID, I've concluded that \"nobody is coming to the rescue\" and that I must take more direct action in the aging space. While great people already work to end aging, we need at least 3 orders of magnitude more resources to see major results in 20-40 years. While aging is my core focus I also have invested opportunistically.",

At the same time Jeff recognized that innovative financial technology, regulation, and investor interest in new fund models had coalesced to provide an opportunity for the next generation of alternative investment firms. RueOne is the new generation. Jeff brings more than 15 years of experience in the hedge fund industry as a fund manager and asset allocator with a strong track record for sourcing new managers and investments. In 2007 he founded Empiric Asset Management, LLC, a family of hedge funds where he raised over $150MM and outperformed equity and energy indices through the Empiric Strategic Income Funds & Empiric Market Neutral Funds. Earlier in his career, Jeff was the Director of Research for ARIS Capital Management, LLC, a fund of hedge funds which employs a global multi-strategy investment approach. While at ARIS, he was responsible for conducting investment and operational due diligence on potential hedge fund investments in addition to serving on the investment committee. Jeff also held positions at The Carlyle Group, Deutsche Bank Advisors and The World Bank and Strategic Financial Solutions. He is an honors graduate of The George Washington University.",
